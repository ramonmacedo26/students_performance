# students_performance

This project is part of my personal portfolio and serves as a practical example of how to apply a data science development process in eight detailed steps. Using the "Student Performance" dataset, this project demonstrates step-by-step from exploratory data analysis to the operationalization of a machine learning model. The steps include:

1 - Problem Definition: Identify and clearly define the problem that the model aims to solve.

2 - Data Acquisition: Load the dataset and prepare it for analysis.

3 - Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory analysis to better understand the characteristics of the data.

4 - Data Preparation: Clean and format the data for modeling.

5 - Model Selection: Choose the appropriate machine learning model for the problem.

6 - Model Training: Train the model using the prepared data.

7 - Model Evaluation: Test the model with test data to assess its performance.

8 - Operationalization: Prepare the model for deployment and practical use, including ongoing monitoring and maintenance.

Explore the repository to understand each step of the process and do not hesitate to get in touch for questions or suggestions. This project not only highlights technical skills in data science but also the ability to follow a structured methodology for data analysis projects.
